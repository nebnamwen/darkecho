Dark Echo notes

(or whatever we want to call it because there's a mobile game called that)

key concepts:
- 1st-person maze exploration (and maybe a little shooting)
- positional audio
- *no video at all* (except maybe for debugging)
- walls revealed by sonar clicks
- procedural, somewhat stylized sound propagation

implementation ideas:
- map is a hex grid
    - walls placed at cell centers and mostly fill cells
- sound propagation by wavefronts emitted *from player*
    - only what the player hears is actually rendered
    - some creatures can hear the player?
- wavefronts diffract around corners as new wavefronts
    - need to work out the math but I think this will work
- sound positioning by adjusting volume *and* delay between ears
    - optimized for headphones, not sure if a speaker mode will work
    - this needs to be tested

object/creature ideas:

- wall
    - blocks movement
        - makes a bump when you bump into it
    - reflects sonar clicks
        - different "colors" of wall with different click sounds?
    - blocks/diffracts sound

- music box
    - your goal is to collect these
    - plays a series of musical notes on loop
    - you should be able to hear these from a distance
        - around corners, too, if diffraction works
    - might be collectible in any order or might unlock/appear in sequence
        - behind doors?

- door
    - wall that disappears when a key (music box?) is collected
    - when closed, responds to sonar clicks with a chord matching its key

- whumpus
    - "boss" or "nemesis" enemy, high threat level
    - makes a distinctive "whump" sound
    - tracks the player by listening for sonar clicks
        - tracks slowly when sonar clicks are diffracted
        - charges when sonar clicks are direct
        - may also respond to other sound events
            - does that mean we need multiple rounds of sound propagation?
    - when shot, is stunned for a while (a few tens of seconds)
    - charge damage is fatal

- shhroom
    - passive hazard
    - emits white noise
        - need to see if white noise is positionable
    - explodes when stepped on or shot
        - does minor damage in a small radius
        - makes a loud bang
            - this might alert the whumpus
        - maybe it only explodes when you step on it?

- shrieker
    - like a Metroid Prime shriekbat
    - "hangs from ceiling" so you can walk right past it if it's not alerted
    - idle sound is an intermittent chirp
    - alerted by direct (not diffracted) sonar pings
    - charges when alerted
        - when charging emits a rapid series of chirps
        - doppler shift would be great to have for this
        - does minor damage on impact
        - continues past player whether it hits or not
        - returns to idle when it hits a wall or the edge of its defined range
        - has a few second cooldown before it can alert again
    - can be killed

- skitter
    - constantly moving
    - makes a skittering noise like lots of little feet
    - follows the edge of its defined range or another defined path
    - does minor damage on contact
    - can be killed
